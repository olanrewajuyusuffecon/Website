# Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. student at Georgia State University specializing in applied microeconomics. My research interests lie in Health Economics, Public Economics, Labor Economics, and Development Economics. I am interested in how healthcare utilization is driven by health insurance and social programs and analyzing the impact of healthcare access on health outcomes.
